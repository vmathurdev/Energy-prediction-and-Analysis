# Metric-Analysis-of-effect-of-Partial-Shading-on-Solar-Panels
Final year Bachelorâ€™s thesis-based project on solar energy analytics. In a group of two, pre-processed data and developed a model to predict the efficiency of solar panel installations during shading. The results of the model across different installations were 90% accurate.
